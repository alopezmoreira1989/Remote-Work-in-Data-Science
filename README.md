# Remote Work in Data Science

This repository contains my data science project originally developed on Kaggle: ( https://www.kaggle.com/code/alejandrolpezmoreira/remote-work-in-data-science ).
The goal is to analyze salaries, job titles, and trends in remote work within the data science field, applying data analysis and machine learning techniques.

## ðŸ“‚ Contents
- `salaries.csv` â€“ dataset used in the analysis  
- `remote-work-in-data-science.ipynb` â€“ main Jupyter Notebook with analysis and ML experiments  
- Supporting scripts and resources  

## ðŸš€ Project Objectives
- Explore salary distribution across roles, experience levels, and remote work status  
- Identify patterns and insights on remote opportunities in data science  
- Apply machine learning models for prediction and trend analysis  

## ðŸ”§ Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Kaggle for prototyping and exploration  

## ðŸ“Š Results
Key insights and visualizations are included in the notebook, highlighting:  
- Salary trends by region and experience  
- Comparison of remote vs. onsite work  
- Predictive modeling for salaries
